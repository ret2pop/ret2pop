#+description: My introduction to the github world

Hi! I'm Ret2pop. Some people know me as LiCoO2 or /Preston Pan/, living in Canada/2005.
Don't worry, I forgot real life names existed too. I used to go to UVic, dropped out, worked at
[[https://layerzero.network][LayerZero Labs]] for a bit, and now, depending on how
updated this page is, I'm just doing my own thing. It's a long story, but the upshot is that
I think there's a lot in this github repository, and on my website that I think you'd love.
Thanks for stopping by!

* Website
You can find me at my [[https://ret2pop.nullring.xyz][website]].
I also have a lot of other websites, but this one will lead you to enlightenment.
