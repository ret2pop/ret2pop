# Ret2Pop
Hi! I'm Ret2pop. Most people know me as LiCoO2 or _Preston Pan_.
Don't worry, I forgot real life names existed too. I go to UVic
and I am currently doing science, probably a physics mathematics
dual degree.

## Website
You can find me at my [website](https://preston.nullring.xyz).
I also have a lot of other websites, but this one will lead you
to enlightenment.

## Languages
It's a complete sterotype at this point but people sometimes want this information:
- C
- C++
- Python
- x86 assembly
Are all the turing complete languages that I like to use. I'm also learning lisp and
rust.
