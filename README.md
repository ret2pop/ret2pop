# Ret2Pop
Hi! I'm Ret2pop. Most people know me as LiCoO2 or _Preston Pan_.
Don't worry, I forgot real life names existed too. I go to UVic
and I am currently doing science, probably a physics mathematics
dual degree.

## Website
You can find me at my [website](https://preston.nullring.xyz).
I also have a lot of other websites, but this one will lead you
to enlightenment.

## Hobbies
- I play the piano pretty well I think
- I play the cello less well but still okay
- I do programming, obviously
- I use linux as a hobby, and administrate the server that I use as a hobby
- I do mathematics and physics as a hobby
- I like thinking about stuff

## Languages
It's a complete sterotype at this point but people sometimes want this information:
- C
- C++
- Python
- x86 assembly

Are all the turing complete languages that I like to use. I'm also learning lisp and
rust.
