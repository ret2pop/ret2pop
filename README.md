# Ret2Pop
Hi! I'm Ret2pop. Some people know me as LiCoO2 or _Preston Pan_, living in Canada/2005.
Don't worry, I forgot real life names existed too. I used to go to UVic, dropped out, worked at
[LayerZero Labs](https://layerzero.network) for a bit, and now, depending on how
updated this page is, I'm just doing my own thing. It's a long story, but the upshot is that
I think there's a lot in this github repository, and on my website that I think you'd love.
Thanks for stopping by!
## Website
You can find me at my [website](https://ret2pop.nullring.xyz).
I also have a lot of other websites, but this one will lead you to enlightenment.
